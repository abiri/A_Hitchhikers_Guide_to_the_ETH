## General Introduction

We think that the individual personality and characteristics of an agent play a major role in the way he chooses his path to a certain destination.
To further understand how these characteristis influence decision making, we propose an agend-based simulation which offers three differing paths to choose from. Depending on his traits, other alternatives will be under consideration.
Despite the strong personal preferences that completely change trail formation, most models simulating human trial formation or pedestrian behavior in urban systems ignore this fact and considers all agents as equal.
That is where we see the importance of a model which would focus mainly on the diversity among the agents and why we investigated the divergence this assumption may have compared to the standart approach.


## The Model

The model will be situated in Zurich, Switzerland, and will concentrate on path decision making of students from the "Central" station to the main building of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ).
As most of the students are not situated around the university in lack of an official campus, the majority uses public transport and arrives at Zurich Main Station and seek their way up the hill to the main halls.

Students are no homogonous matter: they are lasy, sleepy, stressed or in groups. Some are sportive and consider a ten-minutes-walk a good way of clearing the mind,whereas others prefer the comfort of trams and the Polybahn.
Therefore, individual characteristics such as energy, sleep, sociality or stress influence each single student's trail formation differently.

The homogonous agents are assumed to be focusing strictly on the fastest way available. As in reality, trams and the Polybahn depart in intervalls of 5 and 2 minutes respectively.



## Fundamental Questions

We will investigate which changes will be observed by various combinations of different traits.
The main concern is whether scientific simulations with homogonous agents is a valid approximation and its results can be used, or whether the conclusiveness of such tests is strongly diminished.

Another field of research will be to take a look at possible optimisations of the systems (e.g. by increasing the transport frequency or the capacity of the vehicles). 



## Expected Results

We suspect that an agent-based simulation with individual, randomly assorted characteristics will be worth the additional costs, as it is more stable and can be adapted in a more appropriate way
 (i.e. by varying the maximal and minimal values of the variables, which can include trends in an entire population such as obesity).

By taking into account the arriving times of the public transport, the simulation would be more precise, but would also require a much larger amount of computing time, as the time frame has to be decreased drasticly in order to guarantee correct results.
